*It’s a lazy kind of Sunday morning for you and your friends, which means it’s laundry day. When your timer rings, you head to the laundry room to change from washer to dryer, but something’s wrong --- all the washer doors are already open. All your laundry has gone missing. In each of the washing machines, you find calling cards, each printed with the same message:*

<center><i><b>“Come to the Elm Anteroom if your want your laundry back.”</b></i></center>

In January 2020, I designed, produced, and facilitated ***The Great (Yale-NUS) Escape***, together with cocreators [Olivia Dure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RLTA4ayDGw) and [Sheena Diong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheena-diong-442931129). With another semester ahead (and the pandemic not so far away), we wanted to create something fun for the college community --- a memorable way for friends, colleagues, and suitemates to bond face-to-face.

Inside the room, players discover that [IKEA cacti](https://www.ikea.com/sg/en/p/cactaceae-potted-plant-cactus-assorted-70530732/) --- a dorm room decor favorite --- were secretly body-snatching aliens from space. Can players escape the aliens' lair in time to foil their dastardly plans?

For a homebrewed escape room on a minimal budget, I'm very proud of the production value we were able to achieve. We fabricated custom puzzle pieces from wood and acrylic, programmed a Telegram bot so players could "speak with the aliens," and teamed up with the school's [satirical newspaper](https://themocktant.com/2020/01/09/recent-spate-of-succulent-ownership-at-yale-nus-discovered-to-be-alien-invasion/) to hide some easter eggs on the open web.

In the week it was up, we ran over thirty games in five days for over 170 players. Every game was booked out.
