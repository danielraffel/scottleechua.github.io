    abstract={How can we measure trust on illicit darknet market websites? Borrowing from the industrial organization literature, I propose a new empirical strategy that uses vendors' return on reputation as a proxy for trust. I use this strategy to quantify the deterioration of trust on the Dream darknet market in response to Operation Bayonet, a law enforcement operation. I tease apart the effects of the operation's first stage, a conventional market takedown, and its second stage, an impersonation campaign. I find that the latter significantly erodes marketplace trust while the former does not. This decrease in trust manifests as an increase in vendors' returns on reputation. I estimate Operation Bayonet to have increased the difference in mean revenue between a 5-star and a 4-star vendor by 32.5 percentage points. I further find that deterioration in buyer trust concentrates darknet sales in the hands of fewer vendors, raising the barriers to entry and increasing the effectiveness of future anti-vendor law enforcement operations.},

    author={Chua, E. and Chua,S.},
    journal={Forthcoming},
    abstract={In this article, we propose that analyses of Philippine science fiction can meaningfully contribute to the growing intersections of Philippine studies and science and technology studies. We argue that science fiction is not only a literary genre but also a mode of inquiry into our notions of progress and modernity. Through this lens, we examine Gregorio Brillantesâ€™ short story \textit{Apollo Centennial}. Set in a future where the Marcos regime never ended, \textit{Apollo Centennial} demonstrates how state infrastructural interventions can discipline Filipino subjects according to the dictates of an authoritarian techno-future. Nevertheless, the short story gestures to the emancipatory potential of alternative linguistic and sensory modes through which state subjects might imagine other futures that defy narrative sequestration.},

    author={Chua,S. and Chang, J. and Riambau, G.},
    journal={Under review},
    abstract={We investigate lying behavior when lying is undetectable and payoffs are split with charity. 524 participants roll a die in private, report the outcome, and receive the monetary equivalent of their reported number, i.e., there is a clear incentive to lie. Participants are randomly assigned to share all, some, or none of this payoff with a charity of their choice. This allows us to examine how lying behavior changes with the share of payoffs going to charity. Our results are as follows: (i) there are participants in every group who lie to inflate their reported number; (ii) participants with no share of the payoff lie much less than participants with some share, no matter how small; and (iii) post-experiment surveys reveal that participants who keep the whole payoff are much less likely to admit to having cheated than all other participants. Finally, our data suggests that lying is not correlated with any observable sociodemographic characteristic.},

    author={Chua,S. and Riambau, G. and Wertz, T.},
    journal={In progress},
    abstract={We examine how grades affect students' learning using data from a liberal arts college in Singapore. We examine a natural experiment where, in 2017, the grading policy for an introductory statistics module was exogenously changed from letter grade to pass/fail, but the content, format, difficulty, and modes of assessment remained exactly the same. Our dataset includes all results from individual twice-weekly quizzes and two exams for five cohorts: three under letter-grade and two under pass/fail. Our results show that pass/fail students initially work as hard as letter-graded students, but tend to lower their effort as the course goes on, with a sharp decrease right after the first exam. This suggests that, as soon as students realize they have secured a "pass", they choose to allocate their time and effort to other subjects or activities. We further find that intending to major closely related to the subject does not explain relatively better performance under a pass/fail scheme. Our results suggest that pass/fail policies could safely be implemented more extensively: the loss in acquired knowledge is marginal and could easily be compensated in terms of personal time and mental health.}, pdf={https://guillemriambau.com/Riambau,%20Chua,%20Wertz,%20Do_Grades_Enhance_Learning.pdf},
