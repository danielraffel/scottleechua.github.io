    abstract={How can we measure trust on illicit darknet market websites? Borrowing from the industrial organization literature, I propose a new empirical strategy that uses vendors' return on reputation as a proxy for trust. I use this strategy to quantify the deterioration of trust on the Dream darknet market in response to Operation Bayonet, a law enforcement operation. I tease apart the effects of the operation's first stage, a conventional market takedown, and its second stage, an impersonation campaign. I find that the latter significantly erodes marketplace trust while the former does not. This decrease in trust manifests as an increase in vendors' returns on reputation. I estimate Operation Bayonet to have increased the difference in mean revenue between a 5-star and a 4-star vendor by 32.5 percentage points. I further find that deterioration in buyer trust concentrates darknet sales in the hands of fewer vendors, raising the barriers to entry and increasing the effectiveness of future anti-vendor law enforcement operations.},

    title={Lying Behavior When the Payoffs are Shared with Charity: Experimental Evidence},
    author={Chua,S. and Chang, J. and Riambau, G.},
    journal={Under review},
    abstract={We investigate lying behavior when lying is undetectable and payoffs are split with charity. 524 participants roll a die in private, report the outcome, and receive the monetary equivalent of their reported number, i.e., there is a clear incentive to lie. Participants are randomly assigned to share all, some, or none of this payoff with a charity of their choice. This allows us to examine how lying behavior changes with the share of payoffs going to charity. Our results are as follows: (i) there are participants in every group who lie to inflate their reported number; (ii) participants with no share of the payoff lie much less than participants with some share, no matter how small; and (iii) post-experiment surveys reveal that participants who keep the whole payoff are much less likely to admit to having cheated than all other participants. Finally, our data suggests that lying is not correlated with any observable sociodemographic characteristic.},

    title={Do Grades Enhance Learning? Evidence from a Natural Experiment in a Liberal Arts College},
    author={Chua,S. and Riambau, G. and Wertz, T.},
    journal={In progress},
    abstract={We examine how grades affect students' learning using data from a liberal arts college in Singapore. We examine a natural experiment where, in 2017, the grading policy for an introductory statistics module was exogenously changed from letter grade to pass/fail, but the content, format, difficulty, and modes of assessment remained exactly the same. Our dataset includes all results from individual twice-weekly quizzes and two exams for five cohorts: three under letter-grade and two under pass/fail. Our results show that pass/fail students initially work as hard as letter-graded students, but tend to lower their effort as the course goes on, with a sharp decrease right after the first exam. This suggests that, as soon as students realize they have secured a "pass", they choose to allocate their time and effort to other subjects or activities. We further find that intending to major closely related to the subject does not explain relatively better performance under a pass/fail scheme. Our results suggest that pass/fail policies could safely be implemented more extensively: the loss in acquired knowledge is marginal and could easily be compensated in terms of personal time and mental health.}, pdf={https://guillemriambau.com/Riambau,%20Chua,%20Wertz,%20Do_Grades_Enhance_Learning.pdf},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
