In March 2017, I was commissioned by [The Substation](https://www.substation.org/) to design puzzles for ***Detention Class***, an outdoor pop-up installation celebrating ["creativity and playfulness, the two things that might have landed you in detention back in school."](https://ph.news.yahoo.com/step-back-into-the-past-at-armenian-street-party-051903812.html)

The installation was part escape room and part immersive theater. Puzzle-inclined visitors decoded ciphers and cracked locks to break into the teacher's desk, where a treasure trove of [chewing gum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewing_gum_sales_ban_in_Singapore) awaited them. Others played trashcan basketball and shot the breeze with the resident delinquents, played by Shaiful Risan and his band of punks.

*Detention Class* ran for two nights, over the course of the [2017 Armenian Street Party](http://scene.sg/lifestyle/armenian-street-party-2017-5-reasons-to-check-it-out/).
