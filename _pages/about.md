I am interested in economics, a field whose definition is still [in flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_economics). I currently define it as __the study of human relations in, around, and despite modern capitalist systems__ [see [changelog](/economics-definitions)]. This philosophy informs my work, research, and (occasionally) creative writing.

In 2022, I obtained a masters degree in Quantitative Economics from the [National University of Singapore](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/ecs/). I previously graduated summa cum laude from [Yale-NUS College](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/), where I grew to love mathematics, statistics, and [barbershop singing](https://youtu.be/WP9ZUMi2uTc?t=1823).

In 2017, I wrote a fantasy/sci-fi graphic novel called [_Doorkeeper_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36552949-doorkeeper) together with [Ethan Chua](https://twitter.com/daschuapital) and a team of [fantastic Filipino artists](https://doorkeeper-artists.carrd.co/) --- read it [here](https://issuu.com/scottchua/docs/doorkeeper).

At present, I am working on a [new graphic novel](https://twitter.com/scottleechua/status/1321059318549106688?s=20), the [LEGO Darth Vader helmet](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/darth-vader-helmet-75304), and an English translation of Lualhati Bautista's <i>[Dekada '70](https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/theater/dekada-70-musical-review)</i>.
