I am interested in economics, a field whose definition is still [in flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_economics). I currently define it as __the study of human relations in, around, and despite modern capitalist systems__ [see [changelog](/economics-definitions)]. This philosophy informs my work, research, and creative writing.

In 2022, I obtained a masters degree in Quantitative Economics from the [National University of Singapore](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/ecs/). I previously graduated summa cum laude from [Yale-NUS College](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/), where I grew to love mathematics, statistics, and [barbershop singing](https://youtu.be/fMW6zv6wZ1Y?t=1804).

In 2017, I created a fantasy/sci-fi graphic novel called ***Doorkeeper*** together with [Ethan Chua](https://medium.com/@ezlc327) and a team of [fantastic Filipino artists](https://doorkeeper-artists.carrd.co/) --- read it [here](https://penlab.ink/titles/doorkeeper/).

At present, I design board games with [Mosquito Games](https://mosquito.games), write for video games with [Andas Productions](https://andasproductions.com), and chip away at [a new graphic novel](https://twitter.com/scottleechua/status/1522184619285630976?s=20&t=aZErmsFtkQ8fuurrpj40pQ).
